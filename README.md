## Description
Think book club but replace 'book' with 'game'.. yeah.. a Game Club! That's what this project is supposed to be. A club for gamers by gamers. It is a combination of three services; Game reviews, discussions and "Looking for groups" (LFG) services. These three services are grouped up to be game specific, meaning that every game has its own collection of reviews, "LFG's" and forum discussions.
<br><br>
Reviews are plain objective ratings of a game. LFG is meant to help players find like-minded individuals to play and interact with. The forum is meant for all discussions related to the video game.
<br><br>
The project is meant for gamers who are looking for reviews and discussions about a particular game as well as finding other gamers to play with. The average user would discuss the game in the forums section, look for others to play with in the LFG and afterwards review the game in the review service.
